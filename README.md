# BoF-Img-Classification

# Introducing BoF
Interest in using BOF method in the fields of text processing and image processing has increased dramatically in the last decade. This method has many applications including image classification, video search and robot location. Initially, this method, called bag of words, was used to process texts, in which a number of words were selected from sentences and considered as attributes. It is worth noting that regardless of the order of the words, the attributes are used for subsequent processing. This property has led to this method being used in car vision. In image processing, the BOF works by extracting features from the image, except that their location does not interfere. This means that spatial features are removed. As a result, the computational burden is drastically reduced and it has become very popular. An example of applying the BOF method to a face image is shown in the Figure below. As it turns out, features like eyes, eyebrows, etc. are removed from the image regardless of their location in the original image.

The problem of image recognition from the image using the BOF method has been investigated in this project. SIFT features of images have been used for this purpose. The simulation is done with Python programming language and using google colab environment. Google Coolb has provided the possibility of using 12 GB of RAM as well as GPU. It is possible to use SIFT in version 3.4.2 of the open-cv library. Therefore, first it is necessary to install the appropriate version of this library in Google colab. The codes are also written in such a way that the execution time of each method is specified. As a result, it was observed that the implementation of clustering takes more time and the SVM method works much faster in comparison with KNN.

The BOF method is used to extract the features and then two different methods KNN and SVM have been used for classification, which has a higher classification accuracy with the SVM method. Also in KNN method, before using the classifier, the K-means clustering method with 50 clusters was used.
The dataset includes these classes: bedroom, coast, flower, forest, highway, industrial, insidecity, kitchen, livingroom, mountain, office, opencountry, store, street, suburb, and tallbuilding.
